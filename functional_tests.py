    # the attempt is checked against the answer.
    # If correct, Steven is given a congratualtions message.

    # The next question is asked and the number of questions to ask is reduced.
    # The number of ATTEMPTS allowed is reset.

    # Once all the questions are asked, Steven is given a summery of the game.
    # With the number of attempts and the wrong answers
    # Steven is asked wether he would like to re-attempt the questions he got incorrect.

    # If Steven runs out of attempts, he is asked if he would like to continue.
    # If yes, the number of attempts resets for that question. Otherwise the app exits.
